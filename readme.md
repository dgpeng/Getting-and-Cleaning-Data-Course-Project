After upzipping of the "UCI HAR Dataset", the unzipped folder was renamed as "UCI" to simplify the typing later. 

The "run_analysis.R" file was used to read data from "UCI" folder and to create a "tidy_data" dataset as described in the assignment.

Steps to work on this course project

1, Download the data source and unzip the file. And then, you'll have a "UCI HAR Dataset" folder, which should be renamed as "UCI" to run my "run_analysis.R" file.

2, Put run_analysis.R in the parent folder of "UCI", then set it as your working directory using setwd() function in R console.

3, Run source("run_analysis.R"), then it will generate a new file tiny_data.txt in your parent directory of the folder of "UCI".
